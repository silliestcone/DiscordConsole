> DiscordConsole is software aiming to give you full control over
> accounts, bots and webhooks!

### Install

To get started, simply [download the console from
releases](https://github.com/silliestcone/DiscordConsole/releases), or compile it yourself: `go get
github.com/silliestcone/DiscordConsole`

### Usage

It is recommended to run DiscordConsole in a terminal. To do that,
just `cd` to the folder you extracted it and run it by typing
`DiscordConsole`. There are a few launch options. You can display them
by running DiscordConsole with `-h`.

When starting the DiscordConsole in Windows for the first time, you
might get a screen saying that Windows SmartScreen prevented an
unrecognized app from starting. Just click **More Info** and then
**Run anyway**.

Once started, you'll get asked to fill in your token. If it's a bot
token, just type `<token>` in the terminal. If it's a user token,
enter `user <token>`. If it's a webhook, enter `webhook <link>.`

If you have copied your token to your clipboard and are having troubles
pasting it on Windows, use the substitute `${paste}` in place of your token.

Then, just press enter! You'll get the following screen:

Try to type something like `help` and let the magic happen! For a
detailed review of each command, type `help command`.

DiscordConsole also supports the use of quotes `" "` to use more than one word as an argument.
